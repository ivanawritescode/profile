## Welcome to Ivana Writes Code

# A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
an expertly skilled and brilliantly minded medical laboratory technician found herself out of work.  Though in the midst of a global pandemic, it seems our heroine was overly experienced and unable find a position amongst the newly graduated (and thus willing to work for a pittance) influx of scientists.
## So, what did she do?
Fear not, dear reader, for our heroine is no ing√©nue, but a practical woman of science! 
### But, seriously, what did she do?
Ok, I'll tell you...

- She talked to her mother, but that was no use.  
All her mother did was criticise her for not being a doctor already and suggest that she might rectify that, preferably sooner rather than later, because "you are getting very old now, sweetie!"
- She talked to her friends, all of whom are either scientist, doctors or programmers.
  - The scientist rubbed their chins but had no suggestions.
  - The doctors sided with her mother, _naturally_.
  - And the programmers suggested that she try **coding**!

### "I can't code!"
She bemoaned and began listing the reasons why this was a stupid idea:
1. She has zero experience of anything outside of MS Office and the internet.
2. She had long ago come to an understanding with computers that they would leave each other well alone.
3. Sitting for long periods of time at a desk would be _the worst thing ever!_
4. Programming was the sort of "nothing job" that people in "Carpet Land" were paid too highly for and wasn't as "essential" as she was used to being.

But secretly **She was simply scared**
5. She was used to being _The Very Best at Everything_ when it came to medical microbiology and knew she would have to start again. Level 1: Noob.

## What Changed?
A programmer, edit: Engineering Lead, friend of our heroine saw an email at work. The very nice people at [The Coders Guild](https://thecodersguild.org.uk/) were running a free JAMStack course, perfect for luddite like her! He signed her up, offering his support and the promise of cake upon completion.

### **The Cake is a Lie!**... but the rest is history.
